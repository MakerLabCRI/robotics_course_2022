  - ### L298N Dual H-bridge
  


  - ### HC-SR04 Ultrasonic senso
    Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting sound waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. then wait for the sound to be reflected back, calculating distance based on the     time required. 
    calculated based on this formula: Distance = Â½ T x C
  
    T = Time and C = the speed of sound
