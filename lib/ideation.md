### Path Planning Arduino ###

#### Team: Tiffany, Clemence, Romaric

1. <i> Introduction : </i> We will have a robot plan a path through a grid-obstacle course, going from start to finish with avoiding unknown obstacles 

2. <i> Market survey / Bibliography: </i> N/A

3. <i> How you will solve this problem: </i>   
    - We will use a pre-built Zumo Robot for our car. And, we will use ultrasonic sensors for detecting obstacles in the way of the car.  
    - We will learn about path finding algorithms and select an appropriate one to use to move our robot car through the grid obstacle course in the shortest path.
    - We will also use the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles by calculating the distance between the car and the obstacle with differences in sound. 

4. <i> Expected List of Features: </i>
    - Ultrasonic sensor - detect obstacles
    - Fun algorithm - Find shortest path from A to B 

5. <i> List of equipment used: </i>
    - Ultrasonic sensor
    - Zumo Robot
    - Power battery
