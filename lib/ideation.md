Path Planning Arduino 

Team: Tiffany, Clemence, Romaric

1. Introduction : what do you want to do  
We will have a robot plan a path through a grid-obstacle course, going from start to finish with avoiding unknown obstacles 

2. Market survey / Bibliography 
N/A

3. How you will solve this problem   
We will use a pre-built Zumo Robot for our car. And, we will use ultrasonic sensors for detecting obstacles in the way of the car. 
We will learn about path finding algorithms and select an appropriate one to use to move our robot car through the grid obstacle course in the shortest path.
We will also use the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles by calculating the distance between the car and the obstacle with differences in sound. 

4. Expected List of Features
Ultrasonic sensor - detect obstacles
Fun algorithm - Find shortest path from A to B 

5. List of equipment used
Ultrasonic sensor
Zumo Robot
Power battery
